Description: Prepare data for machine learning algorithms by encoding boolean,
    character, factor, and dates variables to a numeric (or int) representation
    and save this preparation for future uses (ex : when you'll run your model
    in real life, you'll have to exactly replicate the original data
    preparation, and that is where mlprepr shines). You'll also find tools to
    deal with variables which distribution and/or type is not stable.
