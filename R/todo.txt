# General

# fct_load
Make sure the types are ok by making double-loading available (load all then load given the types)

# fct_main
Build skeletons for each type (logical, char, factor, date)
Clean management of characters to factor and vice-versa
Check that a "NULL" in learn_transform is correctly dealt with by predict (means that column should be removed, for example because there are no correct levels for a factor)
Apply_transformer should remove all columns that are not listed

Factors : recode rare and others properly

Character : check that char to factor conversion is ok
